# Breast Cancer Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant (harmful) or benign (not harmful). The model achieves an impressive 98% accuracy on the dataset.

## Project Description

This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of a logistic regression model for breast cancer prediction. It covers the following:

  * **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading the breast cancer dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for model training.
  * **Model Building:** Creating and training a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
  * **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
  * **Prediction:** Making predictions on new data using the trained model.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.7 or higher
  * Jupyter Notebook
  * Pandas
  * Scikit-learn

### Installation

1.  **Install Python:** If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2.  **Install Jupyter Notebook:** You can install Jupyter using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```

3.  **Install Pandas and Scikit-learn:** Install the necessary libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```

### Running the Notebook

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AdityaInamdar334/breast-cancer-logistic-regression.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Directory:** Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd breast-cancer-logistic-regression
    ```

3.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4.  **Open the Notebook:** In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` file (or whatever you named your notebook).

5.  **Run the Cells:** Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Additional Notes

  * **Dataset:** The project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset.
  * **Model Performance:** The model achieves 98% accuracy, but it's important to note that this is on the specific dataset used. Performance may vary on different datasets or in real-world scenarios.
  * **Customization:** You can customize the project by exploring different features, hyperparameters, or evaluation metrics.
